1. Overview
This Tableau project is designed to provide a comprehensive view of an organizationâ€™s HR metrics. It showcases critical insights into employee attrition, department-wise distributions, age-group trends, education levels, and job satisfaction ratings. The goal is to help HR professionals and management make data-driven decisions regarding retention strategies, engagement, and overall workforce planning.

2. Key Metrics and Visuals
Employee Count: Total number of employees in the dataset.
Attrition Count & Rate: Total employees who have left and the corresponding attrition rate (percentage).
Active Employees: Number of employees still working.
Department-wise Attrition (Pie Chart): Displays how attrition is distributed across different departments (e.g., Sales, Human Resources, IT, etc.).
Number of Employees by Age Group (Bar Chart): Shows the employee distribution across various age ranges.
Job Satisfaction Rating (Matrix Heatmap): Compares satisfaction scores across departments, job roles, or other factors.
Education Field vs. Attrition (Pie/Bar): Illustrates how different educational backgrounds correlate with attrition.
Attrition by Gender & Age Group (Donut Charts): Breaks down attrition further by gender across age brackets.
3. Data Source and Preparation
Data Source: This dashboard assumes a dataset containing columns such as EmployeeID, Age, Department, JobRole, EducationField, Gender, Attrition, JobSatisfaction, etc.
Cleaning & Transformation: Before importing into Tableau, ensure the data is clean (remove duplicates, handle missing values) and structured properly.
Connection in Tableau: Connect to your data source (Excel, CSV, database) in Tableau Desktop, ensuring the data types (e.g., numeric, string, date) are correct.
4. How to Use the Dashboard
Open the Tableau Workbook: Download and open the .twb or .twbx file in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.
Interact with Filters: Select different departments, education levels, or gender from the filter panel to see how the metrics change.
Hover & Drill Down: Hover over charts to view tooltips with detailed breakdowns. Click on specific data points for further drill-down options.
Reset Filters: Use the reset option to clear selections and return to the default view.
5. Insights and Interpretation
Departmental Hotspots: Identify departments with the highest attrition rates, prompting targeted retention strategies.
Age Group Trends: Spot potential turnover trends in specific age brackets (e.g., younger vs. older employees).
Job Satisfaction Correlation: See how satisfaction ratings might correlate with attrition, revealing which roles or departments may need engagement initiatives.
Education Impact: Evaluate if employees from certain education fields have a higher likelihood of leaving, informing future hiring or training strategies.
6. Customization
Feel free to adjust the dashboard layout, colors, or chart types based on user preference or organizational branding. You can add additional sheets for more advanced metrics (e.g., average tenure, performance ratings, etc.) to enhance the analysis.

7. Requirements
Tableau Version: Ensure you have Tableau Desktop (version 2020.1 or later recommended) or Tableau Public.
Data Source Format: Structured CSV, Excel, or database with clear headers.
System Requirements: A machine capable of running Tableau efficiently, especially for large datasets.
